WHAT IS THIS?

  Just a bunch of dirty homebrew scripts to generate the gul.es webpage.


OK SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

  Some bash, ruby and makefiles.


WHY DON'T YOU USE A SERIOUS CMS?

  They are so insecure and require constant maintenance. And we are too lazy to update it every day. 


AND AREN'T THERE ANY BETTER SOLUTION THAN MAKEFILES AND SCRIPTS?

  Probably yes, but we are too lazy to google it.


OK HOW I USE IT?

  Install GNU make, ruby, and probably something more that I can't remember right now.
  Run make and make test. Go to http://localhost:8080 and there you are.


BUT WHAT ABOUT THE DATABASE?

  Our research team has developed a mechanism to embed a database without using DB servers. 
  They have called it 'files'. They are to write like twenty papers about it and ask for 
  a grant to develop this exciting new technology.


AND WHAT ABOUT THE WEBSERVER? 

  Any web server will work. Just set the html/ directory as the webserver root. And configure it to 
  serve any file as HTML, not only the *.html ones.


WHERE DOES 'MAKE TEST' INSTALL THE APPLICATION? HOW DO I CONFIGURE THE DEPLOYMENT PATH?

  Nowhere. 'make test' runs an embedded webserver. It is a server written in a few minutes,
  just for testing the webpage. Do not use in production, unless you enjoy constant crashes.


WHY ARE YOU USING A HOMEBREW TEST WEBSERVER INSTEAD OF [insert here your favourite embedded webserver]?

  Once more, because we are too lazy to find and configure one. 


WHAT IS THE PUBLISHING WORKFLOW?

  Sorry, the publishing what?


HOW DO YOU PUBLISH A NEW STORY?

  $ Create a file stories/[category]/[id] with the article content. See any existing one as a reference. 
  $ Add [category]/[id] to stories/timeline.
  $ (optional) make ; make test
  $ git push origin master

  The post-receive hook in the server does a "make" and verything is done. But you can use whatever yo prefer:
  rsync, scp, whatever. And you can automate this with a script to, for example, post a story by sending it via 
  email. Someone really did it at gul.es.


SO EVERYTHING IS STATIC, NO DYNAMIC CONTENT IS ALLOWED?

  The only dynamic content is the javascript-driven one, like Twitter and announces. Everything else is static.


RSS?

  /rss


I WILL NOT USE THIS APPLICATION IN MY WHOLE LIFE. I REALY THINK IT'S THE WORST PROJECT PUBLISHED IN 
THE WHOLE INTERNET.

  Worse than NetworkManager?
